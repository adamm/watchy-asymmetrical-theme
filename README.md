# watchy-asymmetrical-theme

My "asymmetrical" theme for [Watchy from SQFMI](https://watchy.sqfmi.com).

![Example output](/media/theme-snapshot.png)

For convenience, this theme is buildable in PlatformIO. If you want to use
Arudino IDE, just import the contents of the src directory and build
according to https://watchy.sqfmi.com/docs/getting-started#arduino-setup
